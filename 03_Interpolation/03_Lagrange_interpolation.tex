\subsection{Lagrange Interpolation}
    We want a base polinomial which satisfies $l_i(x_j) = \delta_{ij}$
    \begin{equation*}
        \colorboxed{red}{l_k(x) = \prod_{\substack{i=1 \\ i \neq k}}^N \frac{x-x_i}{x_k-x_i}}\,
        \colorboxed{red}{\underbrace{f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^N y_k l_k(x)}_{\substack{\textnormal{ Lagrange}\\ \textnormal{Interpolation Function}}}}
    \end{equation*}
    
   
    
    \subsubsection{LSQ vs Interpolation}
        \textbf{Noise:} LSQ better than Interpolation since Interpolation will pass exactly through the points and take noise into account whereas LSQ is robust to noise.
        
        \textbf{Data points:} if we have an exact fit and use more data points for the interpolation than the original functions order the higher order trems will cancel out. If $f$ is $2^{nd}$ order we will need 3 data pointso
        
        \textbf{Stability:} Hard to approx. local behaviour if interpolation function is used as a global function. Oscillatory behaviour at the endpoints (due to higher order functions). Fluctuations in a small region of the data set may cause fluctuations of the function over the whole domain.
